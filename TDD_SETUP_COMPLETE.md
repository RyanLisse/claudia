```bash
npm test              # Run all tests with Vitest
npm run test:unit     # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration  # Integration tests only
npm run test:e2e      # End-to-end tests with Playwright
npm run test:coverage # Tests with coverage report
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode for development
npm run test:ui       # Visual test interface
```

### Code Quality Commands
```bash
npm run lint          # ESLint checking
npm run lint:fix      # Auto-fix ESLint issues
npm run format        # Format code with Prettier
npm run typecheck     # TypeScript type checking
```

### Makefile Shortcuts
```bash
make install         # Install all dependencies
make test           # Quick unit/integration tests
make test-coverage  # Generate coverage report
make quality        # Run all quality checks
make clean          # Clean build artifacts
```

## 🎯 Coverage Configuration

### Vitest Coverage Settings
- **Provider**: V8 for accurate coverage reporting
- **Thresholds**: 90% for branches, functions, lines, and statements
- **Formats**: Text, HTML, JSON, and LCOV reports
- **Output**: `./coverage/` directory

### Coverage Exclusions
- Node modules, build artifacts, configuration files
- Test files themselves
- Type definition files

## 🧪 Test Categories Implemented

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Component Testing**: React component behavior and props
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions and business logic
- **Library Functions**: Core application utilities
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Session Management**: Database operations and lifecycle
- **API Integration**: Mocked Tauri API calls
- **Component Integration**: Multi-component workflows
- **Performance**: Concurrent operations and large datasets

### 3. End-to-End Tests
- **Application Flow**: Complete user workflows
- **Stagehand Integration**: Automated UI interactions
- **Cross-browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge testing
- **Mobile Testing**: Responsive design validation
- **Error Recovery**: Network failure and recovery scenarios

## 🎭 Stagehand Integration Features

### Automated Interaction Patterns
- **Smart Element Detection**: Finds UI elements by text and semantics
- **Form Automation**: Intelligent form filling based on field types
- **Error Recovery**: Handles network failures and retries
- **Accessibility Support**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- **Multi-step Workflows**: Complex user journey automation

### Stagehand-style Test Examples
- Dynamic content loading and waiting
- Complex UI interaction sequences
- Error state detection and recovery
- Element observation and reporting
- Responsive design testing

## 📊 Monitoring and Reporting

### Test Reports Generated
- **Coverage Report**: `./coverage/index.html`
- **E2E Test Report**: `./test-results/` 
- **Playwright Traces**: Video recordings and screenshots on failure
- **Performance Metrics**: Test execution timing and bottlenecks

### CI/CD Ready
- **Fail on Coverage Below 90%**: Enforces quality standards
