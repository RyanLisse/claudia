### Key Improvements Made

#### 1. Next.js Specific Features Tested
- **Client-side rendering**: "use client" directive compatibility
- **Static export**: Proper configuration for Tauri packaging
- **Routing**: Client-side navigation without server dependency
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, code splitting, bundle optimization
- **Build process**: TypeScript compilation, CSS processing, asset handling

#### 2. Tauri Integration Testing
- **File system operations**: Reading/writing files in Tauri environment
- **Native dialogs**: File selection, message boxes, confirmations
- **Window management**: Title setting, minimize/maximize/close
- **Shell operations**: Opening external URLs
- **Environment detection**: Proper Tauri API availability checks

#### 3. Component Testing Enhancements
- **State management**: React hooks, context, form state
- **Event handling**: Click events, keyboard navigation, custom events
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly layouts, breakpoint testing
- **Animation**: Framer Motion integration, performance testing

#### 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases
- **API errors**: Network failures, permission errors, validation errors
- **Build errors**: TypeScript errors, ESLint errors, missing dependencies
- **Runtime errors**: Component errors, missing Tauri API graceful fallback
- **Performance**: Large datasets, build time limits, bundle size limits

## Test Execution Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- Individual component functionality
- State management
