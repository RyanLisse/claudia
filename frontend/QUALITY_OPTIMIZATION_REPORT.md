## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

1. **Update Dependencies** (Critical):
   ```bash
   bun update
   # Review breaking changes carefully
   ```

2. **Security Patches**:
   - Update `zod` to latest stable
   - Update `next` to 15.3.3+
   - Replace or update `electric-sql` (contains vulnerable squel)

3. **Monitor**: Set up automated dependency scanning

## 🏗️ RECOMMENDED ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS

### Monorepo Structure (Implemented):
